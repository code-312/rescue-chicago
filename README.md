## Main

In 2021 alone, Chicago Animal Care and Control, the city’s only publicly funded shelter, took in 4,122 stray, surrendered, or confiscated dogs. While some of the dogs who end up in the municipal shelter will be returned to their owner or adopted out directly, more than half of these animals are transferred to another animal rescue organization through the shelter’s Homeward Bound partnerships.

To learn more about the journeys of these rescued pups, we pulled data from the Petfinder API for dogs located within 100 miles of Chicago. Petfinder is the most widely used online database of adoptable pets. Many Chicago animal rescue organizations maintain their own organization pages and adoptable pet listings on the site. We are building an interactive data visualization dashboard to explore how different dog characteristics affect the average length of stay of these Chicagoland dogs in a shelter or foster placement prior to adoption.

- We heard from Chicago animal rescue volunteers that if they knew why dogs weren't leaving the Chicago municipal shelter quickly then they could share that information with press/media to encourage volunteering and adopting.

- To answer this question, and ultimately work toward getting more animals out of shelters into forever homes, we pulled data from the Petfinder API for dogs within 100 miles of Chicago.

- We then created a first iteration of a publicly-available, interactive data dashboard that can be used to analyze how different dog characteristics may correlate with average length of stay in a shelter prior to adoption.

## How to use this application

1. Clone the repository with Git:

```bash
https://github.com/Code-For-Chicago/rescue-chicago.git
```

2. Request a Petfinder API key and secret [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/).

3. Create a file called `.env` in the root directory. This file is ignored via the .gitignore file to avoid committing secrets.

4. Open `.env` in a text editor and add below as the contents, replacing the parts needed with your personal keys. There is also an .env.example to follow for more help.

    ```
    PETFINDER_KEY=REPLACE_ME_WITH_PETFINDER_KEY
    PETFINDER_SECRET=REPLACE_ME_WITH_PETFINDER_SECRET
    HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_AMBER_URL=REPLACE_ME_WITH_HEROKU_URI
    PETFINDER_STREAMLIT_SHOW_QUERIES=False
    PETFINDER_STREAMLIT_CHART_TYPE=advanced
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/app_name
    LOCATION=Chicago, IL
    ```
    - Set PETFINDER_STREAMLIT_SHOW_QUERIES to False or True if you want to see queries shown on the frontend. False is the default.
    - Set PETFINDER_STREAMLIT_CHART_TYPE to simple, advanced or all, depending which type of chart you would like to see. advanced is the default.
    - Scroll down to [Option 1: Manual](#option-1-manual) on how to setup HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_AMBER_URL
    - ** **OPTIONAL** ** - Scroll down to [Local PostgreSQL Setup](#local-postgresql-setup) on how to setup a local psql database.

5. Now install required modules in requirements.txt:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. To start Streamlit locally:
    ```bash
    streamlit run petfinder-streamlit/Home.py
    ```
    Open the Network URL it gives you in your browser.

### Data Runner

As an alternative to running Data Getter/Cleaner/Putter one at a time in the below directions, you can run the below command in your root directory to run all three at once in a CLI.
Enter the specific location and amount of pages you'd like to fetch.
```bash
python3 petfinder-data/data_runner.py
```

### Data Getter

To pull down the first 100K results for dogs in and around Chicago, you can run:

```python
python data_getter.py
```

max_pages: max_pages is the Maximum number of pages to query over. It's at the bottom of data_getter.py. Currently it's set to 10 pages so API Key usage doesn't max out on the first run of this file. Set max_pages=None to pull all data.

This will create a file called `city_state_animals.pkl` in the `rescuechi/petfinder/data`
folder.

### Data Cleaner

This script reads and saves files locally, so no extra set-up beyond installing the
python requirements is needed.

The script can be run by calling:

```python
python data_cleaner.py
```

This will create a file called `city_state_animals_clean.pkl` in the
`rescuechi/petfinder/data` folder.


### Data Putter

This script syncs data to Heroku's PostgreSQL database. If you want the script to sync data locally, set the uri variable to DATABASE_URL.

```python
python data_putter.py
```

data_putter.py: When this file is run, it stores any information gathered from data_getter.py directly to Heroku's Database. Heroku's DB is capped at 10,000,000 rows of data.

### Heroku PostgreSQL Amber URL

- Option 1: Manual

    To copy the uri manually, you will first need to be part of the team's Heroku account.
    Then, navigate to https://data.heroku.com/ and select the datastore called
    `postgresql-corrugated-21223`. Click on `settings`, then `View Credentials...`, and look for a variable called `URI`.

- Option 2: CLI

    To use the Heroku CLI to get the database URI, first you will need to install the Heroku
    CLI by following the instructions [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli).

    After this is installed and configured, you can run the following command:

    ```bash
    export HEROKU_URL=$(heroku config:get HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_AMBER_URL --app  codeforchicago-rescuechi)
    ```

    You can test that this worked by running and checking that it prints back your uri.

    ```bash
    echo $HEROKU_URL
    ```

### Local PostgreSQL Setup
If you have PostgreSQL installed locally, in the terminal type psql and enter the commands:

```bash
CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password' CREATEDB;
```

```bash
CREATE DATABASE app_name WITH OWNER username;
```

Add a DATABASE_URL with your updated username, password and database name to your .env file. The DATABASE_URL line in your .env file should look like this with your details instead.
> DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username_goes_here:password_goes_here@localhost/app_name_here

Once that's done you can follow the Data Getter & Setter guide up above. In the Data Putter, you will need to set the uri variable to DATABASE_URL instead of HEROKU_URL. I recommend using [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) or [Postbird](https://github.com/Paxa/postbird) to view the data.

## What's next
✅ Expand dataset to other major metro areas in the US.
✅ Add other fields from Petfinder.
Adoptability Rating -  Train regression model to predict LOS.
Expand to other pets.
