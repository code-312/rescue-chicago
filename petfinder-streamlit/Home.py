            "will be returned to their owner or adopted out directly, more than half of these animals are " \
            "transferred to another animal rescue organization through the shelter's Homeward Bound partnerships. To " \
            "learn more about the journeys of these rescued pups, we pulled data from the Petfinder API for dogs " \
            "located within 100 miles of Chicago and other cities. Petfinder is the most widely used online database of adoptable " \
            "pets. Many animal rescue organizations maintain their own organization pages and adoptable pet " \
            "listings on the site. The interactive data visualizations on various pages can " \
            "be used to illustrate how different dog characteristics affect the average length of stay of these " \
            "dogs in a shelter or foster placement prior to adoption. "
